Here is an unordered list of things to do:
* Write up an alternative implementation for network manager, so there are  
  more choices than just a netty based one.
* Add an ant task for generating javadoc pages
* Inject loggers, so we can have mock loggers put in instead so it doesn't 
  write the log to a file when testing like it will eventually when normally
  running.
* Write up interfaces and modules for the numerous aspects of the server
  that are still needed.
* Write more things to do for this TODO.
