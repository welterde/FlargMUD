Here is an unordered list of things to do:
* Write up an alternative implementation for network manager, so there are  
  more choices than just a netty based one.
* Write up interfaces for a command parser, command executor, user and command.
* Implement a command parser, command executor, user and some commands.
* Write some unit tests that test to the fullest extent possible the command
  parser, command executor, user and command implementations.
* Write up some way to register and login to the server, possibly do it like
  I did in RedditMUD.
* Write up some way for commands to be able to last past a single interaction.
  Possibly do it like I did in RedditMUD with the MessageQueue class. By last
  past a single interaction I mean so that a command could prompt the user
  a couple times past the command's invocation, the command would essentially
  take over accepting the user's input until the command is done.
* Think up a better way of handling user ranks than I did in RedditMUD.
* Think quite a bit on how to go about writing a database backend interface so
  that it would be possible for it to be applicable to both SQL and NoSQL 
  databases and possibly flat files as well.  The first implementation will
  most likely be H2 based.
* Think quite a bit on the topic of server scripting and just how much should
  the user should be able to script.  Make sure to have it be quite modular
  so that one could easily replace a JRuby script handler with a Jython based
  one and plenty of other possible scripting languages as well.
* Add an ant task for generating javadoc pages
* Write up interfaces and modules for the numerous aspects of the server
  that are still needed.
* Write more things to do for this TODO.
